# Java Task

## Task-1 ---> Account Manager
This is a simple console-based Java application that simulates a basic banking system. It allows users to manage two accounts (Account 1 and Account 2) with functionalities such as balance inquiries, deposits, withdrawals, and fund transfers. Users can switch between accounts and perform various operations interactively.

## Task-2 ---> eCommerce Platform
This use case focuses on implementing polymorphism to calculate discounts for different user types (Regular Customer, Premium Customer, Employee) in an eCommerce platform. By using a base class Customer with a method calculateDiscount(), and overriding it in subclasses (e.g., RegularCustomer, PremiumCustomer, Employee), the system dynamically calls the appropriate discount calculation method based on the user type.

## Task-3 ---> Hospital Management System
This use case involves building a Hospital Management System that efficiently handles doctors, patients, and administrative staff. Patients can book appointments, view their medical history, and make payments. Doctors can manage appointments and access patient records based on their specialization, while admins manage users, generate reports, and handle system-wide functionalities. The system employs abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to ensure modularity, security, and role-specific actions.

## Task-4 ---> Employee Task Management System
This use case describes an Employee Task Management System that allows managing employee tasks efficiently. The system stores employee information, assigns tasks with details like priority and status, and allows retrieving tasks based on various criteria such as priority or department. Completed tasks are removed, and pending tasks are tracked. It leverages collections such as HashMap for storing employees and tasks, PriorityQueue for task prioritization, and LinkedList for managing pending tasks.

## Task-5 ---> Person Registration Web Application
This is a simple Person Registration web application built using Java (Servlets), MySQL, and HTML/CSS. The application allows users to register their details, which are stored in a MySQL database.
